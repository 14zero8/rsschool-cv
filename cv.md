# About Me
At the moment, I work as an bridge crane operator at a factory and really want to change this job to a remote one. I've always wanted to study programming, as it was my long-standing dream, but unfortunately, it seemed to me that it was very difficult and I couldn't do it, but now I've decided that the time has come for learning and I'm ready to do my best to achieve my goal.
While working at the factory, I was able to master the profession of a 3D interior visualizer and work for 3 years in parallel with my main job. Therefore, I hope for my experience in remote learning and I am sure that it will help me to realize my dream of becoming a programmer.
- My strengths:
  - The ability to keep motivated to learn
  - Attention to details
  - The ability to adequately perceive criticism of their work
  - Correction of mistakes made
